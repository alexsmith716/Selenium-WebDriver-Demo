# Selenium-WebDriver-Demo

## Project Description
Selenium, JUnit and Cucumber demonstration project.

This project demonstrates using a base webdriver class which defines a WebDriver object to be used by Selenium. The base webdriver class instantiates a single WebDriver instance which is then set in a main base page. Subsequent page classes will then inherit WebDriver from the main base page.

## Technologies Used

* Java 8
* Selenium Java 4.0.0
